> Urban Directory: Zenness - A trait where peace, calmness, and inner awesomeness are all intertwined.

Hi. My name Nadiar, a writer of this blog. I am a professional Software Engineer from Garut (a small city in West Java) and currently live in Jakarta, Indonesia.

As like the urban directory said, Zenness is all about the inner calm, the perfect balance.

In this blog, I want to share something about what can make us fell that Zenness. The feeling that make as satisfied. Hopefully, after reading this blog.

As a coder, my thought about Zenness is to share about the pattern, the clean code that make us fell satisfied. And of course, I will not only write about code.

If you find my writing is helpful, please spread this blog to your channel. I will update this blog every week.
